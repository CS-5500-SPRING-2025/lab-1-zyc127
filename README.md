## Task 4: Video Questions (4 marks)

### Q1
The video explains the Software Development Life Cycle with seven stages, which are planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Project goals are defined in planning, features and details are outlined in requirement analysis, and architecture is designed in the design stage. Then, the software is built and tested in implementation and testing, then made available to users in deployment stage. After that, the software is monitored, updated, and supported in the maintenance stage. Those stages makes sure that the final product meets user needs.

### Q2
